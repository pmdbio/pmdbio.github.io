Since my childhood I was passionate about dinosaurs and science. My dream was to become a paleontologist, just like Dr. Grant (Jurassic Park, 1993). This persisted until I entered college when my first contact with cancer biology happened. It really surprised me for it was a very complex theme, so I liked it a lot. Since then, this began to be my main field of study. I graduated in Biological Sciences at the University of Brasília in 2013 and just finished my master's in Health Sciences (August, 2016). During the last course I had to use some program to analyze my data and data available at online repositories (which consisted mainly of gene expression, copy-number alterations, mutations and survival times) and found that the most often used ones were paid, but no one paid for them (yeah...). So I remembered that I once heard about a software called R that could be useful for statistics and the was free. I gave it a shot and "vois là": I simply found myself immersed in it for I couldn't stop studying it and being surprised with the multitude of possibilities it opened for my data analysis process. So now I am a biologist and R programmer.
